                        <h1>EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY</h1>
                        <p>In a bid to tackle the mammoth plastic waste problem in the Philippines, the Republic Act (RA) No. 11898 — otherwise known as the Extended Producer Responsibility Act of 2022 — lapsed into law on the 23rd July 2022. 

                            In a nutshell, the law holds companies accountable for the plastic packaging they produce throughout the lifecycle of their products. 
                            
                            Before this law was introduced, manufacturers were only responsible for the impact of the production of their products, rather than the whole lifecycle. However, they now need to account for all packaging used to protect, transport, and sell the product. This means the legislation impacts both up and downstream business activities.
                            
                            Unlike many EPR systems around the world, the Philippine law includes the recovery of flexible plastic, which has been historically difficult (and sometimes impossible) to sell. This is a game changer for the environment, as it incentivizes people to recover non-recyclable waste.</p>
